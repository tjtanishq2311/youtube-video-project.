This project demonstrates how to implement data encryption and decryption in Python to ensure the confidentiality and security of sensitive information. Encryption is the process of converting readable text (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a secret key or algorithm. 
# 🔐 Data Encryption & Decryption in Python

This repository contains code and examples demonstrating **encryption and decryption** techniques, inspired by the tutorial:

## 📌 Overview
The project shows how to secure data by:
- Encrypting plain text into ciphertext
- Decrypting ciphertext back to the original text
- Using Python libraries for symmetric (Fernet / AES) encryption

This can be used to **protect sensitive information** like passwords, messages, or files.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (Fernet / AES)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts
